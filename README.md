# go-rss

A simple rss aggregator written in Go.

## why

I like to read, specifically content from other talented and cracked software engineers - blogs, newsletters and so on.
Almost every single half-decent solution out there is either charging ridiculous amounts of money as subscriptions or
locking away to good stuff behind event more steeper subscriptions.

"Art and Technology should not be restricted to those who can afford it."

## what

This is part of a larger planned project. While this repo specifically handles the backend logic for a very simple rss-aggregator,
I also intend to develop native cross-platform apps in future which aims to leverage this to allow me to follow and read whatever I want FOR FREE!

Fuck capitalism!

Oh! And if you want, you can self-host the whole thing and you'll have your own rss reader and aggregator!
